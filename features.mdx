## Project Organization and Folder Structures

Organize your documentation projects using flexible folder hierarchies. Create root folders for major initiatives, subfolders for components, and nest further for detailed guides.

### Set Up Your Folder Structure

Follow these steps to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Project Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to the dashboard and click `New Folder`. Name it after your project, such as `MyApp-Docs`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Subfolders" icon="folder">
    Right-click the project folder and select `New Subfolder`. Create sections like `guides/`, `api/`, and `changelog/`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload or Create Docs" icon="file-plus">
    Drag and drop Markdown files or use `New Document` to start fresh.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Example folder structure:

````json
{
  "MyApp-Docs": {
    "guides": ["quickstart.mdx", "features.mdx"],
    "api": ["endpoints.mdx", "authentication.mdx"],
    "changelog": ["releases.mdx"]
  }
}
````

## Document Editing and Formatting Options

2. Click `Share` in the top bar.
3. Select `Public Link` or `Invite Users`.
4. Set permissions: view, edit, or comment.

<CodeGroup tabs="Invite,Public Link">
  ```bash
  # Invite via email
  Invite: team@example.com (Editor)
  ```
  ```text
  # Public read-only link
  https://docs.harshsavani.com/myapp/quickstart
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Harsh Savani automatically tracks changes with built-in version history. View diffs, restore previous versions, and branch for experiments.
